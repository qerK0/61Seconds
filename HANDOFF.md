## [2026-10-16 19:45] SETUP — Project guide and MCP config added
### Done
- Added CLAUDE.md (game summary, architecture, cloud/local work split, rules)
- Added HANDOFF.md (this log)
- Added .mcp.json pointing Claude Code at the MCP for Unity HTTP server
- Added com.coplaydev.unity-mcp (git, #main) to Packages/manifest.json (backup: manifest.json.bak)
### Files created / changed
- CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, .mcp.json — project root
- Packages/manifest.json — MCP for Unity package added
### Needs local wiring (checklist for the MCP session)
- [ ] Open/focus Unity so it resolves the new MCP for Unity package (already in manifest.json)
- [ ] Open Window > MCP for Unity, start the server, confirm it is connected
- [ ] .mcp.json could not be written remotely. In the project root run: `claude mcp add --transport http --scope project unityMCP http://localhost:8080/mcp`
- [ ] Then run `claude`, then `/mcp` and check that unityMCP is listed and connected
### Not verified / risks
- MCP server port assumed 8080 (package default). If the MCP window shows another port, update .mcp.json.
### Next suggested step
- Superseded by the 19:50 entry.
